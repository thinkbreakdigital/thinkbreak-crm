## UUID requirement

- All generated UUIDs must be valid UUID v4.

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating a view without a navigationMenuItem associated. This will make the view available on the left sidebar.
- Creating a front-end component that has a scroll instead of being responsive to its fixed widget height and width, unless it is specifically meant to be used in a canvas tab.

## Best practice

It's highly recommended to create new app entities using `yarn twenty dev:add`. These are the options:

| Entity type          | Command                                  | Generated file                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Object               | `yarn twenty dev:add object`             | `src/objects/<name>.ts`               |
| Field                | `yarn twenty dev:add field`              | `src/fields/<name>.ts`                |
| Logic function       | `yarn twenty dev:add logicFunction`      | `src/logic-functions/<name>.ts`       |
| Front component      | `yarn twenty dev:add frontComponent`     | `src/front-components/<name>.tsx`     |
| Role                 | `yarn twenty dev:add role`               | `src/roles/<name>.ts`                 |
| Skill                | `yarn twenty dev:add skill`              | `src/skills/<name>.ts`                |
| Agent                | `yarn twenty dev:add agent`              | `src/agents/<name>.ts`                |
| View                 | `yarn twenty dev:add view`               | `src/views/<name>.ts`                 |
| Navigation menu item | `yarn twenty dev:add navigationMenuItem` | `src/navigation-menu-items/<name>.ts` |
| Page layout          | `yarn twenty dev:add pageLayout`         | `src/page-layouts/<name>.ts`          |
| Page layout tab      | `yarn twenty dev:add pageLayoutTab`      | `src/page-layout-tabs/<name>.ts`      |
| Command menu item    | `yarn twenty dev:add commandMenuItem`    | `src/command-menu-items/<name>.ts`    |
| View field           | `yarn twenty dev:add viewField`          | `src/view-fields/<name>.ts`           |
| Connection provider  | `yarn twenty dev:add connectionProvider` | `src/connection-providers/<name>.ts`  |

This helps automatically generate required IDs etc.

## Testing

Do not write Playwright, Cypress, or any other end-to-end or front-end test. Do not drive the Twenty web UI, and do not take screenshots of it. The maintainer does that testing personally.

Never start a dev server. Do not run `yarn twenty dev`, `yarn twenty docker:start`, or any other long-running server process. The maintainer starts these personally. If a task seems to need a running server, say so and stop.

Verify work headlessly instead:

- `yarn typecheck` and `yarn lint`
- `yarn test:unit` for unit tests, `yarn test` for integration tests
- `yarn twenty plan --remote local` to review a metadata diff, then `yarn twenty apply --remote local`
- The metadata API at `http://localhost:2020/metadata` and the record API at `http://localhost:2020/graphql`
- `yarn twenty dev:function:logs --remote local` to read logic function output

## Remotes

The `twenty` CLI defaults to the `production` remote, which is the live CRM. Pass `--remote local` on every server-touching command during development. Never run `yarn twenty apply` against production without being asked, and never pass `--force`.

## Model spec

`spec/deals-and-projects.md` documents the Deal and Project model, the junction pattern that gives them multiple contacts, and the SDK constraints and bugs found while building it. Read it before changing objects, fields, or views.

## Versioning

Bump the `version` in `package.json` by 0.0.1 whenever you make a material change. Do it in the same commit as the change, not as a separate follow-up.

A change is material when it alters what gets deployed:

- Any object, field, view, view field, or navigation menu item
- Any logic function, skill, agent, role, or connection provider
- Any front component or page layout
- Any dependency change that reaches the built package

A change is not material when it only touches documentation, comments, or tests. Those need no bump.

Twenty rejects a package version that is already deployed. Skipping the bump makes CD fail with `version must be higher than the currently deployed version`, and the deploy is lost even though CI passes.
